Note: An updated version of this application has been created that contains much of the funcationality of this template but with an updated look and feel. We will continue to fix bugs in this version but all new development efforts will be in the new application. Visit the new template [repo](https://github.com/Esri/Viewer) for more details.

#Instructions

1. Download and unzip the .zip file or clone the repo.
2. Web-enable the directory. 
3. Access the .html page in a browser

Note: If your application edits features in a feature service, contains secure services or web maps that aren't shared publicly or generates requests that exceed 200 characters you may need to setup and use a proxy page. Common situations where you may exceed the URL length are using complex polygons as input to a task or specifying a spatial reference using well-known text (WKT). For details on installing and configuring a proxy page see [Using a proxy page](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html).

For addtional customization options view the [wiki](https://github.com/Esri/basic-viewer-template/wiki).
